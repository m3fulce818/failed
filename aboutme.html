            <p>My name is Michael Fulce and I have had a great time working on this website and writing as if I was Matthew Perry who is one of my favorite actors, as I was planning out what I was going to talk about the news of Matthew Perry's death has shocked the world and has changed how I wanted to end this website. I felt it was necessary to write as myself now as I wouldn't feel comfortable talking from the perspective of Matthew when he is no longer with us. It shocked me and left me in awe I grew to watch FRIENDS from middle to high school with my mom and we grew close and we bonded over FRIENDS, Matthew Perry played my favorite friend Chandler Bing and to hear the news hurt me and my mom as it felt he was our friend because of how close it brought us. Anyway, I'm a 20 year old student trying to get a IT degree to further my knowledge in technology and better my future with what I want to do later in life.</p>

            <p>I actually learned a lot in this class and I was suprised because I took a web design class in high school and thought that was it but after going through the first couple weeks of this class I knew I barley scratched the surface. It was amazing to learn about CSS and all the diffrent styles you can apply to your website such as the floating images and going through the CSS library and exploring all different styles you can add to your website to make it pop more. It was also fun being able to link all the pages together and using the navigation bar to move between each site and expand what you want to say to the reader instead of it being all on one page. I'm really glad I took this class as one day I hope to open up my own tech repair store and to be able to open a website and promote what I want to show to customers at a simple glance would make everything easier in the future.</p>
